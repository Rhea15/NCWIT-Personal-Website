    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Janelia 3D EM Segmentation Research</h2>
    <img src="assets/J Presentation 2025.jpg" width="50%" >
    <p style="font-size: 25px">At the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus, I worked under Dr. Aubrey Weigel and Dr. Jeff Rhoades to improve 3D organelle segmentation in electron microscopy data. I developed a custom PyTorch wrapper with a residual head to extend a pre-trained model, allowing for stepwise learning of new organelles and improving the model’s ability to generalize across datasets. I also produced high-quality 3D segmentation masks that will be published on the OpenOrganelle platform, contributing to ongoing efforts to make large-scale cellular imaging data more accessible and analyzable for the scientific community.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">EmotiWrite</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px">EmotiWrite is an interactive digital journal designed to help users manage stress through natural language processing (NLP). Built with React, Hugging Face, and Firebase, it analyzes users’ written entries to assess emotional tone and stress levels, then provides personalized relief recommendations such as mindfulness activities or reflection prompts. The platform also includes a trend-tracking calendar that visualizes stress patterns over time, empowering users to recognize triggers and improve emotional well-being through data-driven insights.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">EmberSense</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px">EmberSense is an ongoing research project conducted as part of my Academies of Loudoun Senior Research Project. It focuses on predicting wildfire risk across Australia using remote sensing and machine learning. Currently in development, it integrates vegetation stress indices such as NDVI and EVI with historical wildfire data to build an interpretable model that identifies regions at elevated risk before fires occur. The project emphasizes interpretability and ecological context, aiming to produce a transparent, data-informed framework that supports researchers and policymakers in proactive wildfire prevention.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Quantitative Analysis of Rubric-Based Feedback Provided by Claude Sonnet 3.5 for Mathematical Programming Problems</h2>
    <img src="assets/Quantitative Analysis of Rubric-based Feedback Received From Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Mathematical Programming Problems  IEEE Confe.png" width="50%" >
    <p style="font-size: 25px">Through the Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program, I worked under Dr. Mihai Boicu to conduct research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and education technology. I analyzed rubric-based feedback generated by Claude Sonnet 3.5 for mathematical programming problems to evaluate large language model performance and consistency. Over the course of the internship, I completed a research abstract, poster, and paper, presented my findings at the MIT Undergraduate Technology Research Conference, and published the work in IEEE, demonstrating the ability to conduct and communicate applied AI research effectively.</p>

     <h2 style="font-size: 40px">NFL Draft Assistant</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px">The NFL Draft Assistant is a data-driven fantasy football tool that uses gradient-boosted decision trees to identify undervalued players based on historical NFL performance data. The model predicts both total yearly points and breakout potential, measured as a player’s expected improvement percentage, to help users make more strategic draft decisions.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Frosting Frenzy Game</h2>
    <img src="assets/FrostingFrenzyGame.png" width="50%" >
    <p style="font-size: 25px">Frosting Frenzy was a game that I developed using Java Graphics. The game utilized complex Java features to play a game involving baking a batch of cupcakes after memorizing a recipe. The player makes the batch of cupcakes by selecting the required ingredients, baking the cupcakes for the right amount of time, and then placing toppings. At the end of the game, the player will receive a score based on their performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The game also has multiplayer capabilities as it allows 1 - 4 players to play the game, and at the end it reveals the leaderboard of the scores.</p>
