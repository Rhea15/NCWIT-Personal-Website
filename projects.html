    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Frosting Frenzy Game</h2>
    <img src="assets/FrostingFrenzyGame.png" width="50%" >
    <p style="font-size: 25px">Frosting Frenzy was a game that I developed using Java Graphics. The game utilized complex Java features to play a game involving baking a batch of cupcakes after memorizing a recipe. The player makes the batch of cupcakes by selecting the required ingredients, baking the cupcakes for the right amount of time, and then placing toppings. At the end of the game, the player will receive a score based on their performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The game also has multiplayer capabilities as it allows 1 - 4 players to play the game, and at the end it reveals the leaderboard of the scores.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Future Technology Teacher Presentation</h2>
    <img src="assets/Screenshot (202).png" width = "50%">
    <p style="font-size: 25px">A crucial achievement in my journey was winning first place at TSA Nationals with my presentation for the Future Technology Teacher event. For this presentation, I researched the best ways to introduce middle school children to the idea of innovation and problem-solving. Then, I developed a lesson plan that had students go through the engineering design process to build an accessible park in Minecraft. This presentation served a dual purpose as it allowed students to become more empathetic as they imagined the life of a disabled person and it allowed them to engage in the engineering design process. </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Hogwarts Personality Quiz</h2>
    <img src="assets/PersonalityQuiz.png" width = "50%">
    <p style="font-size: 25px">This project was one of my favorite web development projects as it merged my love for web development and the magical world of Hogwarts. In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Java Script to design a personality quiz that sorted the user into their Hogwarts Home. This personality quiz was a creative fusion of two of my interests. </p>
