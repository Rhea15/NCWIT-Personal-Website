                <p>During my internship at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus, I collaborated with Dr. Aubrey Weigel and Dr. Jeff Rhoades to enhance 3D organelle segmentation in electron microscopy datasets. I created a PyTorch wrapper with a residual head to build on a pre-trained model, allowing the system to learn new organelles in a stepwise manner and improve generalization across multiple datasets. Additionally, I generated high-quality 3D segmentation masks that will be shared on the OpenOrganelle platform, contributing to open-access resources for cellular imaging research.</p>
