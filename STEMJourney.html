    <p style="font-size:150%">My journey through STEM involved many hours of hard-work which led to many achievements. These activities and awards encapsulate my profound interest in the field of computer science and have played a significant role in shaping my path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. While it hasn’t always been easy being a female in STEM, I have always been resilient and up to the challenge of closing the gender gap in computer science.</p>

            <p>This fall, I was selected to be a part of an MIT Beaver Works course: CogWorks. In this program, I am learning about various machine learning concepts including advanced NumPy, image classification with Python, and neural networks. My capstone project will be a tool to sort images based on user input.</p>

            <p>Through the Society of Women Engineering High School Visitation program, I toured the engineering labs at UVA. The tours offered me valuable insights into doing an engineering major at UVA. This experience was inspirational as I also had the opportunity to listen to incredible speeches about imposter syndrome and the “definition” of a hacker. </p>

            <p>Last summer, I was chosen to partake in the Leading Ladies Internship. As part of this program, I interned at Loudoun Water and I went to leadership development days where I went to STEM companies such as Sabey Data Center, Micron, and Sentara Hospital to learn about the applications of STEM in the different industries. During my internship days at Loudoun Water, I explored different technologies that played a central role in distributing water such as GIS, CCTV, and SCADA. </p>

                <p>Volunteering at STEAM Foundation</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 8th grade, I started volunteering at STEAM Foundation to introduce other young children to my passion for programming. While I originally started as a Java Assistant Instructor, my creative teaching methods impressed those above me and in 9th grade, I was promoted to a Java Lead Instructor. I was the youngest Lead Instructor at STEAm Foundation. My role as a Java Lead Instructor allowed me to create my own presentations and content to help kids understand Java concepts fluently. </p>
