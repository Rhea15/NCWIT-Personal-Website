    <p style="font-size:150%">My name is Rhea and I am currently  a sophomore at the Academies of Loudoun and Freedom High School. My journey in STEM started when I was in 7th grade, when I wrote my first Java program. From there my journey has evolved as I have learned many programming languages and competed in many different STEM competitions. In my free time, I enjoy programming, doing puzzles, playing the piano, and reading. My aspiration is to channel my passion for computer science and make meaningful contributions to the world.</p>
